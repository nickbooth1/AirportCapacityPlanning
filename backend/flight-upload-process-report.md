# Flight Upload Process Analysis Report

## Overview
This report summarizes the analysis of the flight upload process pipeline, from CSV upload to stand allocation.

## Process Flow
1. **Front End to Upload API**: User uploads the CSV file
2. **Upload to Processing**: The uploaded file is processed
3. **Processing to Validation**: Data is validated 
4. **Upload to Column Mapping**: Columns are mapped
5. **Column Mapping to Processing**: Mapped data is processed
6. **Validation to Review**: Processed data is validated and reviewed
7. **Approval to Stand Allocation**: Approved data is used for stand allocation

## Key Findings

### Issues Identified and Fixed:
1. **Column Mapping Issue**: The system was not properly handling snake_case field names (e.g., `airline_iata` vs. `airlineIata`) in the CSV. This was fixed by modifying the `processUpload` method in `FlightUploadService.js` to handle both naming formats.

2. **Upload Status Constraint**: There was a database constraint violation on the `upload_status` field. The fix was to ensure we use valid status values from the enum ('pending', 'processing', 'completed', 'failed', 'approved').

3. **Base Airport for Origin/Destination**: The system was incorrectly using 'UNKN' for the missing origin or destination instead of the base airport. This has been fixed to:
   - For arrivals: Origin = CSV origin_destination_iata field, Destination = Base Airport
   - For departures: Origin = Base Airport, Destination = CSV origin_destination_iata field

### Current Status:
- **CSV Processing**: Working correctly with snake_case field names
- **Validation**: All flights are being validated successfully (16/16 flights)
- **Origin/Destination**: Correctly using the base airport (MAN) instead of 'UNKN' placeholder
- **Stand Allocation**: All flights are being allocated to stands (100% allocation rate)

### Expected Behavior:
1. **Base Airport Usage**: The system now correctly uses the configured base airport (e.g., 'MAN' for Manchester) as the origin for departures and the destination for arrivals.

2. Aircraft type normalization is working correctly (e.g., "777" → "B777", "380" → "A380")

## Modified Components
1. **FlightProcessorService.js**: Updated to fetch the base airport configuration and use it for normalizing flights
2. **StandAllocationAdapter.js**: Updated to use the base airport code instead of 'XXX' placeholder

## Conclusion
The flight upload and processing pipeline is now working correctly with the `fixed_with_snake_case_fields.csv` file. The previous issues with validation of airlines, airports, and flight numbers have been resolved, and the system now correctly handles the base airport for origins and destinations.

## Recommendations
1. Consider adding more robust logging in the column mapping phase to make debugging easier
2. Consider standardizing the placeholder values used for unknown values (use 'UNKN' consistently)
3. Add more comprehensive validation for the CSV format and required columns
4. Add better error handling for database constraints with user-friendly messages
5. Add a validation step to ensure the base airport is configured before attempting to process flights

## Test Script
A test script (`test-direct-flight-flow.js`) has been created to validate the entire process flow from upload to allocation. This script can be used for regression testing in the future.
