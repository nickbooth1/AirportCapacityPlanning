## Coverage Gaps and Recommendations

### Phase 3 Coverage Gaps

1. **Dashboard Framework** - Missing backend integration tests for saved dashboards and configurations
   - **Recommendation**: Add integration tests for dashboard persistence and sharing

2. **Performance Tracking** - Partial coverage of performance metrics collection and analysis
   - **Recommendation**: Add dedicated tests for performance metric accuracy and completeness

3. **Mobile Experience** - Limited testing of mobile-specific features
   - **Recommendation**: Expand mobile E2E test coverage with device emulation

### Phase 4 Coverage Gaps

1. **Impact Simulation** - Partial coverage of autonomous decision impact simulation
   - **Recommendation**: Add integration tests for impact prediction accuracy

2. **Public-Facing Components** - No tests for stakeholder portal
   - **Recommendation**: Implement E2E tests for stakeholder experience

3. **Multi-Airport Capabilities** - No tests for network-level intelligence
   - **Recommendation**: Develop integration tests for multi-airport data exchange

4. **Advanced ML Features** - Limited testing of reinforcement learning components
   - **Recommendation**: Add specialized tests for ML model accuracy and behavior

## Test Execution Guidelines

1. **Integration Tests**: 
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run test:integration
   ```

2. **E2E Tests**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run test:e2e
   ```

3. **Combined Test Suite**:
   ```bash
   ./run-all-tests.sh
   ```

## Test Monitoring

Test coverage is monitored through the following tools:

1. **Jest Coverage Reports**: Available in `/reports/coverage/` after test execution
2. **E2E Test Videos**: Automatically captured in `/frontend/tests/e2e/videos/`
3. **Test Summary Dashboard**: Available at the CI/CD pipeline results page
