Problem Statement:
I need a forecasting capability that predicts future stand capacity requirements based on historical data, planned infrastructure changes, expected flight schedules, and growth projections. This tool should help airport planners understand how stand capacity will evolve over different time horizons and identify when additional infrastructure investments may be needed.

Algorithm:
1.  **Load Historical Data and Future Parameters:**
    *   Import historical stand capacity and utilization data.
    *   Load planned infrastructure changes (new stands, stand closures, maintenance schedules).
    *   Incorporate known future flight schedule changes and airline growth projections.
    *   Define forecasting parameters (time horizon, confidence levels, seasonal factors).

2.  **Establish Baseline Capacity Model:**
    *   Calculate baseline stand capacity using the StandCapacityTool algorithm.
    *   Segment capacity by aircraft type, terminal area, and time period.
    *   Establish seasonal patterns and peak/off-peak variations.
    *   Create normalized baseline metrics accounting for typical operational disruptions.

3.  **Apply Infrastructure Change Modifiers:**
    *   For each planned infrastructure change, calculate capacity impact.
    *   Model the effect of stand additions, removals, or reconfigurations.
    *   Incorporate maintenance schedules and temporary capacity reductions.
    *   Create a time-phased capacity evolution map.

4.  **Model Demand Growth Scenarios:**
    *   Incorporate airline growth projections and market forecasts.
    *   Apply aircraft fleet evolution trends (retirements, new aircraft types).
    *   Model multiple growth scenarios (conservative, moderate, aggressive).
    *   Calculate stand demand by aircraft type for each scenario.

5.  **Perform Gap Analysis:**
    *   Compare projected demand against projected capacity for each time period.
    *   Identify capacity shortfall periods by aircraft type and terminal area.
    *   Calculate the magnitude of capacity gaps.
    *   Determine when capacity thresholds will be exceeded.

6.  **Generate Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Propose infrastructure development timelines to address capacity gaps.
    *   Suggest schedule optimization strategies to maximize existing capacity.
    *   Model the impact of potential adjacency rule modifications.
    *   Calculate the cost-benefit ratio for different mitigation options.

7.  **Perform Sensitivity Analysis:**
    *   Vary key assumptions and parameters to test forecast robustness.
    *   Identify critical factors most affecting capacity forecasts.
    *   Calculate confidence intervals for capacity projections.
    *   Determine early warning indicators for capacity constraints.

8.  **Generate Visualization and Reports:**
    *   Create time-series visualizations of capacity evolution.
    *   Generate capacity-demand comparison charts for different scenarios.
    *   Produce detailed capacity gap reports with mitigation recommendations.
    *   Create interactive dashboards for scenario testing.
