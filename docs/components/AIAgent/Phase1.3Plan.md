## Current Progress
We have implemented several key components for the knowledge retrieval system:

1. **WorkingMemoryService (Enhanced)**: 
   - Entity mention tracking
   - Knowledge retrieval result storage 
   - Retrieval history tracking
   - Comprehensive context building
   - Utility methods for working with entities

2. **RetrievalAugmentedGeneration (RAG) Service**:
   - Knowledge-grounded response generation
   - Context-aware retrieval integration
   - Smart knowledge chunking for context window management
   - Fallback mechanisms for insufficient knowledge cases
   - Multi-stage generation with fact checking

3. **FactVerifier Service**:
   - Statement extraction and verification
   - Fine-grained factual accuracy checking
   - Confidence scoring for verified statements
   - Automatic correction of inaccurate responses
   - Response comparison for consistency checking

4. **ProactiveInsightsService**:
   - Scheduled and event-triggered insight generation
   - Pattern and anomaly detection in airport data
   - Prioritization of insights by impact and relevance
   - Context-aware recommendations
   - Feedback incorporation mechanisms
   - Insight tracking and organization

## Next Steps
The next task is to implement the MultiStepReasoningService, which will handle complex problems requiring multiple steps of analysis and reasoning.

This service will:
1. Break down complex questions into logical reasoning steps
2. Maintain intermediate reasoning state between steps
3. Combine results from multiple reasoning paths
4. Provide explanations for the reasoning process
5. Handle uncertainty and evaluate alternative approaches
