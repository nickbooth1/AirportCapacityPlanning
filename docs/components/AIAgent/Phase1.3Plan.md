# Airport Capacity Planner AI - Phase 1.3 Implementation Plan

## Overview
Phase 1.3 focuses on implementing Knowledge Retrieval Components for the Airport Capacity Planner AI, enabling the agent to retrieve and process relevant knowledge from various sources to answer user queries accurately.

## Implementation Sections

- [x] Base Agent Service Architecture
- [x] NLP Pipeline Integration
- [x] Query Processing Framework

### 1.2 Knowledge Base Integration
- [x] Stand Data Service
- [x] Maintenance Data Service 
- [x] Airport Configuration Data Service
- [x] Reference Data Service
- [x] Data Transformation Services
- [x] Caching Mechanism (TTL-based)

### 1.3 Query Types Implementation
- [x] QueryHandlerBase
- [x] QueryRegistry
- [x] Asset Query Handlers (Stand, Terminal, Pier)
- [x] Reference Query Handlers (Airport, Airline, Aircraft)
- [x] Maintenance Query Handlers
- [x] Operational Query Handlers

### 1.4 NLP Components

### 1.5 Knowledge Retrieval Components (Current Phase)
- [x] KnowledgeRetrievalService
- [x] WorkingMemoryService (Enhanced for context management) - **JUST COMPLETED**
- [ ] RetrievalAugmentedGeneration (RAG) Service - **NEXT TASK**
- [ ] FactVerifier
- [ ] ProactiveInsightsService
- [ ] MultiStepReasoningService
- [ ] ResponseGeneratorService
- [ ] Integration Tests

### 1.6 Performance Optimization
- [ ] Query Caching
- [ ] Knowledge Indexing
- [ ] Response Time Metrics
- [ ] Parallel Processing Optimizations
- [ ] Resource Monitoring

## Current Progress
We have just completed the enhancement of the WorkingMemoryService to support knowledge retrieval, adding capabilities for:
- Entity mention tracking
- Knowledge retrieval result storage
- Retrieval history tracking
- Comprehensive context building
- Utility methods for working with entities

We also updated the KnowledgeRetrievalService to integrate with the enhanced WorkingMemoryService.

## Next Steps
The next task is to implement the RetrievalAugmentedGeneration (RAG) Service, which will combine retrieved knowledge with generative AI to produce accurate and contextually relevant responses.

This service will:
1. Accept knowledge items retrieved by KnowledgeRetrievalService
2. Integrate with LLM via OpenAIService
3. Use prompt engineering techniques to guide the LLM's response generation
4. Ensure factuality by grounding responses in retrieved knowledge
5. Manage context window limitations through smart chunking
6. Implement fallback mechanisms when knowledge is insufficient
