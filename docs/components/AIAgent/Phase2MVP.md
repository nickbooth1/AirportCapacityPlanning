   Implementation Strategy and Dependencies

  Critical Dependencies

  - Phase 2 depends on successful completion of Phase 1
  - Scenario calculation depends on accurate data models from Phase 1
  - Visualization quality depends on calculation accuracy

  Parallel Development Opportunities

  - Frontend work can occur in parallel with backend development
  - Visualization components can be developed while calculation engine is being built
  - Testing frameworks can be established early in each phase

  Suggested Approach

  1. Begin with core query handling to establish the foundation
  2. Implement CRUD operations once basic queries work
  3. Enhance the chat interface iteratively throughout Phase 1
  4. Start Phase 2 with scenario modeling and basic calculations
  5. Add visualizations after calculations are validated
  6. Implement reasoning capabilities last as they depend on other components

  Key Success Metrics

  - Phase 1: Agent correctly answers 90%+ of common asset and maintenance questions
  - Phase 1: CRUD operations complete successfully 95%+ of the time
  - Phase 2: Scenario calculations match manual calculations with 95%+ accuracy
  - Phase 2: Users can successfully create and analyze scenarios with minimal guidance

  This two-phase approach allows for delivering immediate value with the query-answering capabilities while building toward the more complex scenario planning functionality.
