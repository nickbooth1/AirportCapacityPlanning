# Stand Maintenance Module Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for the Stand Maintenance module as specified in the CapaCity MVP. The module will manage maintenance requests for stands, including request creation, approval workflow, and integration with capacity calculations to account for stand unavailability during maintenance periods.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Database Schema and Foundation
- [x] Create `maintenance_status_types` table migration
- [x] Create `maintenance_requests` table migration 
- [x] Create `maintenance_approvals` table migration
- [x] Add necessary indexes to the tables
- [x] Implement initial seed data for status types
- [x] Set up API route structure for maintenance endpoints

### Phase 2: Core Maintenance Request Management
- [x] Implement maintenance status type model
- [x] Implement maintenance request model with relations
- [x] Create CRUD API endpoints for maintenance requests:
  - [x] `GET /api/maintenance/requests`
  - [x] `POST /api/maintenance/requests`
  - [x] `GET /api/maintenance/requests/:id`
  - [x] `PUT /api/maintenance/requests/:id`
  - [x] `GET /api/maintenance/requests/stand/:standId`
- [x] Implement `MaintenanceRequestService` in backend
- [x] Implement validation for maintenance request data
- [x] Create basic UI components for maintenance management
- [x] Build maintenance request listing page with filtering capabilities
- [x] Implement maintenance request creation form
- [x] Build maintenance request detail view

### Phase 3: Approval Workflow Implementation
- [x] Implement maintenance approval model
- [x] Create API endpoints for approvals:
  - [x] `POST /api/maintenance/approvals`
  - [x] `GET /api/maintenance/approvals/request/:requestId`
- [x] Implement `MaintenanceApprovalService` in backend
- [x] Implement status transition logic (e.g., Requested â†’ Approved/Rejected)
- [x] Build UI for approval workflow
- [x] Implement approver interface for reviewing requests
- [x] Add email notification placeholders for status changes (optional)

### Phase 4: Calendar Visualization
- [x] Set up calendar component in frontend
- [x] Implement API endpoint to fetch maintenance data in calendar format
- [x] Build maintenance calendar view
- [x] Add filtering capabilities to calendar view (by terminal, pier, status)
- [x] Implement basic calendar interactions (click for details, etc.)

### Phase 5: Capacity Engine Integration
- [x] Implement `MaintenanceCapacityIntegrationService`
- [x] Modify Stand Capacity Engine to access maintenance data
- [x] Update capacity calculation logic to exclude stands with scheduled maintenance
- [x] Implement API endpoint to fetch maintenance impact on capacity
- [x] Build UI for visualizing maintenance impact on capacity
- [x] Create impact summary view showing affected capacity metrics

### Phase 6: Testing and Refinement
- [x] Write unit tests for maintenance request model and service
- [x] Write unit tests for approval workflow
- [x] Write integration tests for maintenance-capacity integration
- [x] Perform end-to-end testing of UI workflows
- [x] Validate that maintenance data correctly affects capacity calculations
- [x] Performance testing for calendar view with many maintenance events
- [x] Refine and optimize database queries

### Phase 7: Advanced Features (if time permits)
- [x] Implement notifications for key events (new requests, approvals, etc.)
- [x] Add recurring maintenance scheduling capability
- [ ] Implement maintenance history and reporting
- [ ] Add bulk operations for maintenance requests
- [ ] Implement scheduled maintenance planning tools

## Dependencies
- Airport Definition module must be fully functional
- Stand Capacity Engine must be operational for integration
- User Interface components for forms, tables, and calendar must be available

## Risk Assessment
- Integration with Stand Capacity Engine may require coordination with that component's development team
- Calendar visualization with many maintenance events may have performance implications
- Complex approval workflows may require additional requirement clarification

## Progress Tracking
- Phase 1: Completed
- Phase 2: Completed
- Phase 3: Completed
- Phase 4: Completed
- Phase 5: Completed
- Phase 6: Completed
- Phase 7: In Progress (40%)
