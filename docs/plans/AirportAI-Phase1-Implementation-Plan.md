# AirportAI Agent: Phase 1 Implementation Plan

This document outlines the step-by-step implementation plan for delivering Phase 1 of the AirportAI Agent. The plan is designed to ensure that the end result is a fully testable user journey that demonstrates the core value proposition of the agent.

## Phase 1 Goals and Success Criteria

By the end of Phase 1, we will deliver:

1. A functional AirportAI Agent that can answer basic questions about current airport state
2. Integration with existing backend APIs for data retrieval
3. Basic visualization capabilities embedded in responses
4. A dedicated Agent Hub page for history and saved insights
5. User approval workflow for write operations
6. An end-to-end testable user journey

## Implementation Phases

The implementation is divided into six key phases:

1. **Foundation**: Core architecture and environment setup
2. **Backend Services**: NLP processing and API integration
3. **Agent Core**: Reasoning and tool orchestration
4. **Frontend Components**: UI elements and visualization
5. **Integration**: Connecting all components
6. **Testing & Refinement**: Ensuring quality and reliability

## AI Integration Specification

For Phase 1, we will integrate with OpenAI using the following specifications:

- **AI Provider**: OpenAI
- **Model**: O4-Mini 
- **Capabilities**: Natural language understanding, context management, domain-specific knowledge
- **Integration Type**: API-based using OpenAI's REST endpoints
- **Authentication**: API key management with secure environment variables
- **Cost Management**: Implement token usage tracking and rate limiting

Future phases will expand on this foundation with more advanced capabilities, including voice integration (speech-to-text and text-to-speech) for conversational interfaces.

- **Multi-language Support**: Add support for multiple languages in speech

### Advanced Visualization (Phase 2-3)
- **Interactive Charts**: Allow users to manipulate and explore visualizations
- **3D Airport Visualizations**: Show spatial data in three dimensions
- **Real-time Data Updates**: Live-updating visualizations for operational data

### Proactive Insights (Phase 3-4)
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify unusual patterns in airport operations
- **Predictive Alerts**: Warn about potential capacity issues before they occur
- **Optimization Suggestions**: Proactively suggest improvements to operations

## User Journey Validation

To ensure we have a fully testable user journey, the following key scenarios must be validated before completing Phase 1:

### Basic Information Query Journey
1. User navigates to any system page where agent is accessible
2. User opens agent chat panel and asks about current capacity
3. Agent processes query, retrieves data, and responds with text and visualization
4. User can view and interact with the embedded visualization

### Saved Insights Journey
1. User asks a question and receives a useful response with visualization
2. User saves the response as an insight with a title and category
3. User navigates to the Agent Hub page
4. User can find the saved insight in the appropriate category
5. User can view, export, or continue the conversation from the saved insight

### Write Operation Journey
1. User requests a maintenance operation (e.g., "Schedule maintenance for stand A3 next Monday")
2. Agent processes the request and presents an approval prompt with impact information
3. User reviews and approves the action
4. Agent executes the operation and confirms success
5. User can verify the action was completed in the relevant system area

## Timeline and Milestones

| Week | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| Week 1 | Foundation setup completed |
| Week 3 | Backend services implemented |
| Week 4 | Agent core functionality working |
| Week 6 | Frontend components implemented |
| Week 8 | Full integration completed |
| Week 10 | Testing completed and ready for user acceptance testing |

## Success Measurement

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. The agent can successfully answer 90% of test queries about current airport state
2. Users can save and retrieve insights through the Agent Hub page
3. The action approval workflow successfully processes and executes approved actions
4. All defined user journeys can be completed without errors
5. Performance meets the criteria defined in the Phase 1 design document (response time under 2 seconds for 95% of queries)
