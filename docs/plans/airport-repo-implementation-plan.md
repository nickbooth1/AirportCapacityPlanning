## Data Processing Approach

### Initial Import Pipeline
1. Collect raw data from all sources into staging tables

3. Deduplicate records based on IATA/ICAO codes
4. Resolve conflicts using priority hierarchy of sources
5. Validate geospatial data (coordinates, elevations)
6. Transform to final schema format
7. Load into production database
8. Generate import statistics and data quality report

### Ongoing Updates
1. Schedule regular updates from primary sources
2. Flag changed records for manual review
3. Implement audit logging for all data changes
4. Create admin interface for manual data corrections
5. Generate regular data quality reports
