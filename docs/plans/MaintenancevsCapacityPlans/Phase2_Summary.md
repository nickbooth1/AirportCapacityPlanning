# Phase 2 Implementation Summary: CLI Tool with Live Data

## Accomplished Tasks

We have successfully implemented Phase 2 of the maintenance impact analysis project. This phase involved transitioning the CLI tool from using mock data to fetching live data from the database and service layers. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

### Core Components Implemented

1. **Database Connector (`db.js`)**
   - Created a robust database connection utility
   - Implemented proper initialization and connection verification
   - Added graceful error handling and connection termination
   - Added diagnostic functions for connection testing

2. **Service Classes**
   - **StandCapacityToolService**
     - Implemented service to calculate baseline stand capacity using live data
     - Added methods to retrieve time slots and aircraft compatibility from database
     - Created data transformation logic from database format to analyzer format
   
   - **MaintenanceRequestService**
     - Implemented service to fetch maintenance requests by date range and status
     - Added proper filtering by date range and status
     - Created detailed reporting structure for maintenance impacts

3. **Live CLI Implementation (`live_cli.js`)**
   - Created asynchronous command-line interface for live data
   - Implemented robust database connection management
   - Preserved the same command-line arguments with focus on date range selection
   - Added detailed error reporting for database connection issues

4. **Testing and Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive test script (`test_live_cli.sh`) with multiple scenarios
   - Added detailed documentation in `README-LIVE.md`
   - Documented database prerequisites and table requirements
   - Updated Phase 2 documentation with implementation details

### Key Features

1. **Real-time Data Integration**
   - Tool connects to live database for real-time analysis
   - Data is fetched directly from database tables
   - Results reflect the current state of the database
   - Detailed diagnostic information for troubleshooting

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Database connection errors are properly reported
   - Validation failures are explained with clear messages
   - Date input is validated before processing

3. **Performance Considerations**
   - Efficient database queries with appropriate joins
   - Proper resource cleanup after execution
   - Connection pooling for live database access

4. **Flexibility**
   - Support for different date ranges (day, week, month)
   - Output to file or console
   - Consistent data processing pipeline

## Testing

The implementation includes a comprehensive test script that validates:
- Single day analysis with live data
- Multi-day analysis with date ranges
- Error handling for invalid inputs
- Console output functionality
- Database connection verification

## Technical Details

1. **Database Integration**
   - Direct connection to PostgreSQL database
   - Table-level access with proper query construction
   - Schema-based data modeling and transformation

2. **Data Processing Pipeline**
   - Fetch base capacity data from live sources
   - Retrieve active maintenance requests for the specified period
   - Calculate capacity reduction for each request
   - Aggregate results by day and impact type
   - Format output with detailed breakdown

## Next Steps

With Phase 2 complete, we are ready to move to Phase 3, which will involve:
1. Implementing a full backend REST API service
2. Creating endpoints for capacity impact analysis at different time horizons
3. Designing the service for integration with the frontend application
4. Adding caching mechanisms for improved performance

Phase 2 provides a solid foundation for these next steps by establishing the core data integration patterns and analysis logic that will be used in the REST API implementation.
