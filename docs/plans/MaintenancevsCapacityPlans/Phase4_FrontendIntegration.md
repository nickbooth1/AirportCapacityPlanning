# Phase 4: Frontend Integration - Implementation Progress

## 1. Goal

Integrate the backend `AggregatedCapacityImpactService` API endpoint into the frontend to visualize the daily capacity impacts. This primarily involves creating or updating UI components (likely charts) on the dashboard and potentially the maintenance requests page.

## 2. Prerequisites

- [x] Completion of Phase 3: The backend service and its API endpoint (`GET /api/capacity/impact-analysis` or similar) are fully functional and tested.
- [x] API documentation for the new endpoint is available and clear.
- [x] Frontend development environment is set up, and there's a clear understanding of which pages/components will display this information.
- [x] A charting library (e.g., Chart.js, Recharts, Nivo) is available in the frontend stack, or a decision has been made on which one to use.

## 3. Task Breakdown (High-Level)

### 3.1. API Client Integration (Frontend)

- [x] **Create/Update API Client Function:**
    - [x] In the frontend's API utility/service layer, added a function to call the new backend endpoint in `frontend/src/api/capacityApi.js`.
    - [x] The function accepts `startDate` and `endDate` as parameters.
    - [x] It handles the API request and response, including error handling.
    ```javascript
    // Implementation in frontend/src/api/capacityApi.js
    export const getCapacityImpactAnalysis = async (startDate, endDate) => {
      try {
        const url = new URL(`${API_BASE_URL}/capacity/impact-analysis`);
        url.searchParams.append('startDate', startDate);
        url.searchParams.append('endDate', endDate);
        
        const response = await fetch(url);
        
        if (!response.ok) {
          const errorData = await response.json();
          throw new Error(errorData.message || 'Failed to retrieve capacity impact analysis');
        }
        
        return await response.json();
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error getting capacity impact analysis:', error);
        throw error;
      }
    };
    ```

### 3.2. Data Fetching and State Management in Components

- [x] **Identify/Create Container Components:** Created `CapacityImpactAnalysis.js` component to handle data fetching and state management.
- [x] **Date Range Selection:**
    - [x] Implemented UI elements for date selection including date pickers and predefined range selectors (7 Days, 14 Days, 30 Days, Month, Quarter).
    - [x] Implemented state management for date range using React's `useState` hook.
- [x] **Data Fetching Logic:**
    - [x] Used `useEffect` hook to trigger data fetching when the selected date range changes.
    - [x] Implemented loading and error states.
    - [x] Stored the fetched array of daily impact data in the component's state.

### 3.3. Charting Component Implementation

- [x] **Chart Type Selection:** Implemented a stacked bar chart using Recharts library showing:
    - [x] Base segment: Available capacity (`finalNetCapacity`)
    - [x] Middle segment: Potential impact from maintenance
    - [x] Top segment: Definite impact from maintenance
- [x] **Data Transformation for Charting:**
    - [x] Transformed the API response data into the format required by Recharts.
    - [x] Extracted values for daily capacities and impact reductions.
- [x] **Chart Component Implementation:**
    - [x] Created `CapacityImpactChart.js` using Recharts library.
    - [x] Configured axes, labels, legends, and colors (green for available capacity, grey for potential impact, red for definite impact).
    - [x] **Tooltips/Popovers:** Implemented custom tooltips showing:
        - [x] Original and available capacity values
        - [x] List of maintenance requests contributing to impacts
        - [x] Request details like stand code and title
- [x] **Responsiveness:** Used `ResponsiveContainer` to ensure chart is responsive to different screen sizes.

### 3.4. Integration into Pages

- [x] Added the CapacityImpactAnalysis component to:
    - [x] The maintenance requests page (`frontend/src/pages/maintenance/requests.js`)
    - [x] A dedicated capacity impact analysis page (`frontend/src/pages/capacity/impact-analysis.js`)
- [x] Ensured the date range selection mechanism is well-integrated with clear UI.

### 3.5. Frontend Testing

- [x] **Component Tests:** 
    - [x] Created unit tests for the CapacityImpactAnalysis component
    - [x] Successfully tested rendering, loading state, error handling, and summary display
    - [x] Fixed test issues with ResizeObserver needed for chart component
- [x] **End-to-End Tests:**
    - [x] Manually tested with backend integration
    - [x] Verified correct data display for different date ranges
    - [x] Tested interactions with the chart
    - [x] Tested with various data scenarios

### 3.6. User Feedback and Iteration

- [x] Initial manual testing complete
- [ ] Gather feedback from users/stakeholders on the visualization's clarity and usefulness (pending deployment).
- [ ] Iterate on the chart design, tooltips, or data presentation based on feedback (future task).

## 4. Implementation Details

### Files Created/Modified:

1. **API Client:**
   - `frontend/src/api/capacityApi.js` - Added `getCapacityImpactAnalysis` function
   - `frontend/src/config.js` - Created for proper API URL configuration

2. **UI Components:**
