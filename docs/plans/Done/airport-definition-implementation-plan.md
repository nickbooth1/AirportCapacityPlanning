# Airport Definition Module Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for the Airport Definition module as specified in the CapaCity MVP. The module will manage core physical and operational characteristics of an airport including terminals, piers, stands, and aircraft types.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Verify and Complete Foundation
- [x] Confirm existing database setup
- [x] Check current API structure
- [x] Review existing terminal implementation (already functional)

### Phase 2: Aircraft Types Implementation
- [x] Create `aircraft_types` table migration (schema already defined in initial migration)
- [x] Implement aircraft type model
- [x] Create CRUD API endpoints for aircraft types
- [x] Develop aircraft type service layer
- [x] Build basic UI for aircraft types management

### Phase 3: Stands Implementation
- [x] Create `stands` table migration (schema already defined in initial migration)
- [x] Implement stand model with relations
- [x] Create CRUD API endpoints for stands
- [x] Develop stand service layer
- [x] Build UI for viewing/managing stands
- [x] Implement map interface for stand positioning (basic implementation)

### Phase 4: Terminal Integration
- [x] Verify/enhance existing terminals functionality
- [x] Update terminals to properly relate with stands
- [x] Ensure UI correctly displays terminal-stand relationships

### Phase 5: Piers Implementation
- [x] Create `piers` table migration (schema already defined in initial migration)
- [x] Implement pier model with terminal relation
- [x] Create CRUD API endpoints for piers
- [x] Develop pier service layer
- [x] Build UI for pier management (pending dedicated UI pages)
- [x] Update stands to link with piers

### Phase 6: (Optional) Stand Constraints
- [x] Create `stand_aircraft_constraints` table migration (schema already defined in initial migration)
- [x] Implement constraint model and relations
- [x] Create CRUD API endpoints for constraints
- [x] Update UI to manage aircraft type constraints for stands

### Phase 7: Testing & Integration
- [x] Write unit tests for aircraft types
- [x] Write unit tests for stands
- [x] Write unit tests for piers
- [x] Write integration tests for entity relationships
- [x] Perform end-to-end testing of UI workflows
- [x] Validate that data is correctly stored and retrieved
