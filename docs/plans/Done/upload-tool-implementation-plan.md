# Flight Upload Tool Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the steps required to implement the Flight Upload Tool, which consists of two main components: the `UploadTool` for handling file uploads and the `UploadQA` for validating and reviewing uploaded flight data. The implementation will follow a phased approach to ensure each component is properly developed, tested, and integrated.
