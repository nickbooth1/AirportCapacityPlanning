# Stand Capacity Tool - Narrow/Wide Body Visualization Implementation Notes

## Overview

The Stand Capacity Tool has been enhanced to show capacity by narrow-body vs wide-body aircraft instead of by specific aircraft types. This document provides a summary of the changes that have been implemented.

## Completed Changes

### 1. Database Changes

- ✅ Added `body_type` column to the `aircraft_types` table
- ✅ Created and ran migration script to add the column
- ✅ Created and executed a script to populate body types based on size categories
- ✅ Added NOT NULL constraint to ensure all aircraft have a body type

### 2. Backend Changes

- ✅ Updated `StandCapacityService` to calculate capacity by body type
- ✅ Modified `calculateCapacityForTimeSlot` to track capacity by narrow/wide body type
- ✅ Added body type aggregation to the calculation results
- ✅ Enhanced the API response structure to include body type visualization data
- ✅ Added support for filtering by:
  - Time slots
  - Stands
  - Fuel-enabled stands
  - Terminals
  - Piers
- ✅ Updated the `_filterStandsByLocation` method to properly handle terminal and pier filtering

### 3. Frontend Changes

- ✅ Created a new `BodyTypeCapacityChart` component for visualizing narrow/wide body data
- ✅ Added filter controls for all the supported filter options
- ✅ Added view mode toggles to switch between:
  - Chart vs Table view
  - Body Type vs Aircraft vs Size Category view
  - Simple, Detailed, and Stacked chart types
- ✅ Implemented summary statistics display showing:
  - Total capacity across all time slots
  - Average capacity per time slot
  - Narrow body / wide body ratio
  - Breakdown by best-case and worst-case scenarios

## Testing

The implementation has been tested with the following approaches:

1. Unit testing of backend services
2. Manual testing of the frontend visualization
3. End-to-end testing of the capacity calculation and visualization workflow

## Known Issues

1. **Test Data**: Additional test data for 30 stands with varied capabilities and adjacency relationships still needs to be created.
2. **Full Edge Case Testing**: While the core functionality works, comprehensive edge case testing is still pending.

## Next Steps

1. Create comprehensive test data with 30 stands and adjacency relationships
2. Complete full integration testing with the enhanced test data
3. Complete user guide documentation with screenshots
4. Perform edge case testing and ensure responsiveness on all screen sizes

## Screenshots

(Screenshots will be added once the test data is complete)

## Conclusion

The Stand Capacity Tool has been successfully enhanced to visualize capacity by narrow/wide body aircraft, providing airport planners with better insights into the airfield's capacity. The new filtering capabilities also allow for more focused analysis based on specific operational requirements.
