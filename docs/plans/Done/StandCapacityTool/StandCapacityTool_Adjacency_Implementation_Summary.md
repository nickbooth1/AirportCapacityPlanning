# Stand Capacity Tool: Adjacency Implementation Summary

## Completed Work

We have successfully implemented the stand adjacency functionality in the Airport Capacity Planner application. The completed work includes:

1. **Fixed Core Issues**:
   - Resolved the `_filterStandsByLocation` method error by properly defining it as a class method
   - Fixed JSON serialization issues in the capacity results retrieval

2. **Enhanced Adjacency Model**:
   - Validated that the database schema includes all necessary fields for adjacency rules
   - Ensured proper typing and relationships between stands and adjacency rules

3. **Implemented Adjacency Logic**:
   - Created a robust implementation of the `_getCompatibleTypesWithAdjacency` method
   - Added a new `_filterTypesByMaxSize` helper method for size-based aircraft filtering
   - Implemented handling for all three types of adjacency restrictions (no use, size limited, aircraft type limited)

4. **Updated Capacity Calculator**:
   - Enhanced the `calculateCapacityForTimeSlot` method to properly use adjacency data
   - Applied adjacency rules based on their restriction types
   - Ensured proper narrow/wide body categorization with adjacency constraints

5. **Created Testing Framework**:
   - Developed comprehensive test cases covering all adjacency rule types
   - Created an automated test script to verify adjacency implementation

6. **Added Documentation**:
   - Created technical documentation explaining the adjacency implementation
   - Developed user guide for the adjacency feature

## Remaining Tasks

The following tasks still need to be completed:

1. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test UI display of adjacency-impacted capacity
   - Test body type classification with adjacency constraints
   - Verify CSV export with adjacency-constrained capacity data

2. **User Acceptance Testing**:
   - Verify the implementation with real-world adjacency scenarios
   - Gather feedback from users on the clarity of results display

## How to Test

To test the adjacency implementation:

1. Run the adjacency test script:
   ```bash
   cd docs/plans/tests
   ./run-adjacency-test.sh
   ```

2. Manually test with the UI:
   - Create adjacency rules through the UI
   - Run capacity calculations
   - Verify the difference between best and worst case capacity

## Lessons Learned

1. Proper error handling for JSON fields is essential when working with complex data structures.
2. Testing with multiple adjacency rule types ensures robust implementation.
3. Clear documentation of adjacency impacts helps users understand capacity differences.

## Future Enhancements

1. Visualization of stand adjacency constraints in the UI
2. Ability to simulate "what-if" scenarios with different adjacency rules
3. Enhanced reporting to highlight adjacency-constrained stands
4. Support for more complex adjacency rules based on time of day
