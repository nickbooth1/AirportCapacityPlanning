## Data Processing Approach

### Initial Import Pipeline
1. Collect raw data from all sources into staging tables
2. Clean and normalize GHA names and identifiers
3. Deduplicate records based on name and location similarity
4. Extract and classify service types from text descriptions
5. Map GHAs to airports based on collected data
6. Transform to final schema format
7. Load into production database
8. Generate import statistics and data quality report

### Ongoing Updates
1. Schedule regular updates from primary sources
2. Flag changed records for manual review
3. Implement audit logging for all data changes
4. Create admin interface for manual data corrections
5. Generate regular data quality reports

## Integration Points
- Airport Component: Reference airports served by GHAs
- Capacity Planning: Associate handling capacity with GHAs
- Schedule Planning: Assign appropriate handlers to flights
- Reporting System: GHA details for operational reports
- User Interface: GHA lookups and filtering

## Maintenance Strategy
- Semi-annual full refresh from primary sources
- Quarterly check for new/changed GHAs at major airports
- Alert system for inconsistencies in GHA data
- Admin dashboard for data quality metrics
- User feedback mechanism for reporting missing or outdated GHA information

## Risk Assessment
- **Data Fragmentation**: Unlike airlines and airports, GHA data is not standardized or centralized
  - Mitigation: Multi-source approach with manual verification for key airports
- **Incomplete Coverage**: May not capture all GHAs, especially at smaller airports
  - Mitigation: Prioritize major airports and handlers, with gradual expansion
- **Service Classification**: Inconsistent service descriptions across sources
  - Mitigation: Develop robust classification algorithm with manual review
- **Airport Associations**: Difficulty in mapping GHAs to all airports they serve
  - Mitigation: Start with direct airport website data, supplement with other sources
- **Data Maintenance**: Resource requirements for keeping data current
  - Mitigation: Automation for major sources, prioritized updates for key airports

## Success Criteria
- Database populated with at least 200 major global GHAs ✅
- All major international airports (top 100) have associated GHAs ✅
- Service type classification accuracy >90% for major handlers ✅
- UI enables efficient search and filtering of GHAs ✅
