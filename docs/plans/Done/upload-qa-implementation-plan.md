# UploadQA Component Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the steps required to implement the UploadQA component, which is responsible for validating flight data after it has been uploaded, checking airport and airline codes against system repositories, and providing users with a clear interface to review and approve valid flights while excluding invalid ones. The interface will separate arrivals and departures into distinct tabs for easy management.
