# Flight Schedule Processing Workflow Integration Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the steps required to integrate the existing Upload Tool, Flight QA Tool, and Stand Allocation Tool into a seamless end-to-end workflow within the Airport Capacity Planner. Currently, these components operate independently, with the Flight QA Tool and Stand Allocation Tool primarily functioning as CLI-based prototypes. This integration will create a cohesive user experience where users can upload a flight schedule, validate it, allocate stands, and visualize the results through the web interface.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Enable users to upload flight schedules and optionally trigger validation and stand allocation
2. Validate flight data using the existing Flight QA Tool's validation rules
3. Allocate stands to flights using the Stand Allocation Tool
4. Save uploaded and processed flight schedules as standalone entities
5. Visualize stand utilization based on the allocation results
6. Identify and display over/under utilization issues
7. Allow users to review and address allocation issues
8. Provide recommendations for mitigating identified problems

### Technical Requirements
1. Integrate CLI-based tools into the web application architecture
2. Pass data between components without requiring file I/O
3. Store processed flight schedules and their results in the database
4. Implement a service to orchestrate the end-to-end workflow
5. Create visualization components for allocation results
6. Optimize performance for large flight schedules
