# Airline Repository Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for implementing the Airline Repository component, which will serve as a centralized database of airlines with industry standard code references. This is a critical foundation for data validation and airline identification across the Airport Capacity Planner application.

## Objectives
1. Implement a robust database schema for storing airline information
2. Populate the database with comprehensive airline data from authoritative sources
3. Create APIs for accessing and validating airline information
4. Integrate the repository with other application components

## Timeline
- Database Schema Design: 1 day ✅
- Initial Data Collection: 2 days ✅

- Database Implementation: 2 days ✅
- API Development: 3 days ✅
- Integration & Testing: 2 days ✅
- Documentation: 1 day ✅
- **Total**: ~13 days (approximately 2.5 weeks) ✅ COMPLETED

  - [x] `getAirlineByIATA(code)`
  - [x] `getAirlineByICAO(code)`
  - [x] `findAirlines(query)`
  - [x] `validateAirlineReference(code, type)`
  - [x] `createAirline(data)`
  - [x] `updateAirline(id, data)`
  - [x] `deactivateAirline(id)`
- [x] Add API authentication and rate limiting
- [x] Create API documentation

### Phase 6: Integration & Testing (2 days) ✅
- [x] Integrate with data import processes
- [x] Add airline validation to flight schedule components
- [x] Create unit tests for all repository methods
- [x] Develop integration tests for API endpoints
- [x] Implement data quality tests for the populated database
- [x] Performance testing for large airline lookups

### Phase 7: Documentation & Deployment (1 day) ✅
- [x] Create user documentation for airline repository
- [x] Document data sources and update frequencies
- [x] Create admin guide for maintaining airline data
- [x] Plan for periodic data refresh strategy

## Data Collection Details

### Primary Data Sources

#### 1. OpenFlights Airline Database
- URL: https://openflights.org/data.html
- Format: CSV
- Contents: ~6,000 airlines with IATA/ICAO codes, country, status
- Collection Method: Direct download and import
- Update Frequency: Manual updates a few times per year

#### 2. IATA Airline Member List
- URL: https://www.iata.org/en/about/members/airline-list/
- Format: Web page
- Contents: Current IATA member airlines with codes
- Collection Method: Web scraping with permission
- Update Frequency: Monthly

#### 3. ICAO Aircraft Operator/Airlines List
- URL: https://www.icao.int/publications/DOC8585/Pages/Search.aspx
- Format: Web interface (requires subscription)
- Contents: Official operator designators and codes
- Collection Method: API access or subscription download
- Update Frequency: Quarterly

#### 4. National Aviation Authority Data
- Sources: FAA (US), EASA (EU), CAA (UK), etc.
- Format: Various (CSV, XML, PDF)
- Contents: Registered air carriers
- Collection Method: Mix of API access and structured document parsing
- Update Frequency: Varies by authority

### Secondary/Supplementary Sources

#### 5. Wikipedia Airline Lists
- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_airlines
- Format: HTML tables
- Contents: Comprehensive lists by country, with codes and details
- Collection Method: Web scraping with focused parsers

#### 6. Airline Website Data
- Method: Targeted scraping of official airline websites
- Purpose: Verify and supplement data from primary sources
- Collection Method: Custom scrapers for major airlines only
- Update Frequency: Quarterly for active airlines

## Data Processing Approach

### Initial Import Pipeline
1. Collect raw data from all sources into staging tables
2. Clean and normalize airline names and codes
3. Deduplicate records based on IATA/ICAO codes
4. Resolve conflicts using priority hierarchy of sources
5. Transform to final schema format
6. Load into production database
7. Generate import statistics and data quality report

### Ongoing Updates
1. Schedule regular updates from primary sources
2. Flag changed records for manual review
3. Implement audit logging for all data changes
4. Create admin interface for manual data corrections
5. Generate regular data quality reports

## Integration Points
- Flight Schedule Import: Airline code validation
- Reporting System: Airline details for reports
- User Interface: Airline lookups and selection
- Data Export: Airline reference data in exports

## Maintenance Strategy
- Quarterly full refresh from primary sources
- Weekly check for new/changed airlines
- Alert system for missing airlines in imported data
- Admin dashboard for data quality metrics

## Risk Assessment
- **Data Quality**: Risk of incomplete or outdated airline information
  - Mitigation: Multiple source cross-validation
- **Data Access**: Some sources may require paid subscriptions
  - Mitigation: Budget for at least one authoritative commercial source
- **Performance**: Large airline lookups could impact system performance
  - Mitigation: Implement caching and optimized indexes
- **Compliance**: Need to respect terms of use for each data source
  - Mitigation: Document all sources and their usage terms
