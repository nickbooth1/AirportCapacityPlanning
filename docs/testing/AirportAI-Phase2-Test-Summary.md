# AirportAI Phase 2 - Performance Testing Summary

This document provides an overview of the performance testing approach and results for Phase 2 of the AirportAI implementation. The testing ensures that the system meets its Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for response time and throughput.

## Test Overview

The performance testing strategy for AirportAI Phase 2 focuses on three critical areas:

1. **NLP Processing Performance**: Measuring response times for natural language understanding and processing
2. **Scenario Calculation Performance**: Evaluating the system's ability to perform complex capacity impact calculations
3. **API Response Time**: Testing API endpoints under various load conditions

## Test Files

The following test files have been implemented:

| Test File | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `/backend/tests/performance/agent/nlpProcessingTime.test.js` | Tests NLP processing performance for different complexity levels |
| `/backend/tests/performance/agent/scenarioCalculationTime.test.js` | Tests scenario calculation performance for varying scenario sizes |
| `/backend/tests/performance/agent/apiResponseTime.test.js` | Tests API response times under different load conditions |

## Running the Tests

To run all performance tests:

```bash
cd /Users/nick/AirportCapacityPlanner
npm run test:performance
```

To run specific test files:

```bash
npx jest backend/tests/performance/agent/nlpProcessingTime.test.js
npx jest backend/tests/performance/agent/scenarioCalculationTime.test.js
npx jest backend/tests/performance/agent/apiResponseTime.test.js
```

## Performance Thresholds

### NLP Processing Time

| Complexity | Threshold | Description |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| Low        | 500ms     | Simple queries (e.g., "Show current capacity") |
| Medium     | 1,500ms   | Moderate complexity (e.g., "What's the impact of closing stands A1-A5?") |
| High       | 3,000ms   | Complex queries with multiple parameters |

### Scenario Calculation Time

| Scenario Size | Threshold | Description |
|---------------|-----------|-------------|
| Small         | 2,000ms   | Small-scale scenarios (1-2 stands, 1 day) |
| Medium        | 10,000ms  | Medium-scale scenarios (terminal closure, 1 week) |
| Large         | 30,000ms  | Large-scale scenarios (seasonal planning, multiple months) |

### API Response Time

| Endpoint | Single Request Threshold | Description |
|----------|--------------------------|-------------|
| Process Prompt | 1,000ms | NLP endpoint for processing user prompts |
| Get Scenarios | 300ms | Retrieving list of scenarios |
| Get Scenario By ID | 500ms | Retrieving a specific scenario |
| Create Scenario | 1,500ms | Creating a new scenario |
| Calculate Impact | 5,000ms | Calculating capacity impact for a scenario |

| Concurrency | Threshold | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| Low (10 req) | 1,500ms | Average response time under low concurrency |
| Medium (25 req) | 3,000ms | Average response time under medium concurrency |
| High (50 req) | 6,000ms | Average response time under high concurrency |

## Testing Approach

### NLP Processing Tests

- Tests different complexity levels of user prompts
- Measures processing time for each complexity level
- Ensures batch processing is efficient
- Verifies performance consistency across multiple requests

### Scenario Calculation Tests

- Tests calculations with various scenario sizes and complexities
- Measures calculation time for different types of scenarios
- Tests parallel calculation capabilities
- Verifies performance under repeated calculations

### API Response Time Tests

- Tests individual endpoint response times
- Measures performance under increasing concurrency
- Tests resource-intensive endpoints under load
- Ensures the system maintains acceptable response times under pressure

## Interpreting Results

For each test run, the following metrics are reported:

- Response time for each test case
- Comparison against defined thresholds
- Average response times for concurrent requests
- Performance degradation (if any) under load

## Performance Optimization Recommendations

If any tests fail to meet the defined thresholds, consider implementing these optimizations:

1. **NLP Processing**:
   - Implement response caching for common queries
   - Optimize prompt templates
   - Consider using a more efficient model for simpler queries

2. **Scenario Calculation**:
   - Implement partial calculation caching
   - Add database indexes for frequently accessed data
   - Optimize database queries for calculation operations
   - Consider parallel processing for independent calculations

3. **API Performance**:
   - Implement API response caching where appropriate
   - Optimize database queries
   - Consider horizontal scaling for high-load scenarios
   - Implement request throttling or queuing for resource-intensive endpoints

## Continuous Performance Testing

To ensure ongoing performance quality:

1. Run performance tests as part of the CI/CD pipeline
2. Monitor performance metrics in production
3. Implement alerts for performance degradation
4. Conduct regular load testing exercises

## Advanced Load Testing

For more comprehensive load testing beyond what's included in these Jest tests:

1. **Using k6**:
   ```bash
   k6 run k6-scripts/scenario-api-load.js
   ```

2. **Using Apache JMeter**:
   - Import the JMeter test plan from `jmeter-plans/airportai-load-test.jmx`
   - Configure the number of users and ramp-up period
   - Run the test and analyze results

## Conclusion

The performance tests implemented here provide a solid foundation for ensuring the AirportAI system meets its performance requirements. Regular testing and monitoring will help maintain acceptable performance levels as the system evolves.
