This is a stress test scenario with 50 flights and will produce complex output.
The expected outcome is for the algorithm to:
1. Process all 50 flights in the busy morning slot
2. Successfully allocate as many flights as possible given the stand constraints
3. Correctly identify and report flights that cannot be allocated due to:
   - Maintenance conflicts
   - Stand size incompatibility
   - Required contact stands not available
   - Terminal/airline base mismatches
   - Adjacency rule conflicts
   - Timing conflicts (stands already occupied)

Performance metrics to observe:
- Number of flights successfully allocated
- Number of flights unallocated
- Distribution of reasons for unallocated flights
- Processing time 

===== ALLOCATED FLIGHTS =====
Flight BA101 (B737) allocated to stand T1-A1 from 06:15 to 07:30
Flight BA102 (B737) allocated to stand T1-A1 from 06:15 to 07:30
Flight QF701 (A380) allocated to stand T3-A1 from 06:45 to 07:45

===== UNALLOCATED FLIGHTS =====
Flight LH201 (A320) not allocated: No suitable stand available
Flight LH202 (A320) not allocated: No suitable stand available
